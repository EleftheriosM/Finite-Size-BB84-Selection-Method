# Finite-Size-BB84-Selection-Method

This code finds the optimized parameters for Alice's state :

qX is the proportion of qubits in the computational basis

Pmu1, Pmu2 are the proportions of the sigmal pulses and the weak decoy pulses

mu1, mu2 are the average photon numbers of the signal and weak decoy pulses

eta_TH is the transmittance cutoff

When run it produces:
